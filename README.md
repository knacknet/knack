Knack
=====

The goal for Knack is to make life easier for: 

 - Developers who want to create OWIN-compatible middleware 
 - Developers who want to create web frameworks on top of OWIN 
 - Developers who want to create web application servers that can run OWIN applications 
 - Developers who want to write micro, low-level web applications

Notes
-----

The Knack code has not yet been renamed from Owin.Common -> Knack.  I'll be doing that today!

I'll be making the screencast available on [http://remi.org][remi] shortly in a 
number of downloadable formats, so you can view a higher quality video.

I also intend on releasing more Owin screencasts in the coming days and weeks.
