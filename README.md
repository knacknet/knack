Knack
=====

Note: The Knack code has not yet been renamed from Owin.Common -> Knack.  I'll be doing that today!

Standard library for OWIN (*Open Web Interface for .NET*)

Website & Documentation: [http://knacknet.org][site]

Screencast: [http://www.viddler.com/explore/remitaylor/videos/52/][viddler]

I'll be making the screencast available on [http://remi.org][remi] shortly in a 
number of downloadable formats, so you can view a higher quality video.

I also intend on releasing more Owin screencasts in the coming days and weeks.
